Objective
=========
In this project, the team will try to build an integrated interactive exploratory model using the Environment data obtained from the World Bank.

We wish the user can use our model to visualize:

1. Different impacts of each key indicator among all countries at a specific time<br>
2. The impacts of specific key indicator among interested countries over a period of times<br>
3. The interested indicators' impacts on all countries at a specific time<br>

Through our model, we hope to give expert users a holistic view of the environment data published by the world bank, and gain valuable insights on relationships among different countries, time periods, and key environmental indicators through interactivity before they conduct in-depth statistical analysis on the data; and provide general users a clear yet simple way to understand the environment data and show them the main factors that affecting their national environment and global environment.

In addition, we are also trying to raise environmental awareness through this visualization project.

Project Motivation
==================
As we continue to grow into a globally inter-connected world where the nations, culture and social proportions mix-up, the environment pollution rises more concerns and is no more a problem that can be solved by only a few countries. Due to global water & air cycle the globe needs openness and cooperation, too. While plenty of countries have advanced environmental protection, many other countries and even regions suffer from a lack of adequate awareness and action. Meanwhile, there is always a need for all countries to manage their historical environmental data to have an overview, compare to other countries and make movements. There are some existing visualizations of world environment but they cannot fulfill the increasing need of processing the data in multiple dimensions. Our team aims at finding a solution to visualize data of most environmental indicators by country over years and help countries to find the trend and make comparison.
